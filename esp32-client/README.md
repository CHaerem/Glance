- **Waveshare 13.3" E-Paper HAT+** (SPI interface)
- **LiPo Battery** (3.7V, 2000mAh+ recommended)
- **Jumper wires** for connections

## üì° Software Requirements

- **PlatformIO** (recommended) or Arduino IDE
- **Raspberry Pi** running Glance server on local network

## üîå Hardware Connections

| ESP32 Pin | HAT+ Pin | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| 21        | PWR      | Power Control |
| 15        | BUSY     | Busy Signal |
| 4         | RST      | Reset |
| 17        | DC       | Data/Command |
| 16        | CS_S     | Chip Select Slave |
| 5         | CS_M     | Chip Select Master |
| 18        | CLK      | SPI Clock |
| 23        | DIN      | SPI Data |
| GND       | GND      | Ground |
| 3V        | VCC      | Power Supply |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: WiFi credentials
export WIFI_SSID="YourWiFiNetwork"
export WIFI_PASSWORD="YourWiFiPassword"

# Optional: Device configuration
export DEVICE_ID="esp32-001"        # Default: esp32-001
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token"    # Default: NONE
```

### 2. Build and Upload

```bash
# Build, upload, and monitor in one command
./build.sh

# Or use individual commands:
./build.sh compile    # Build only
./build.sh upload     # Build and upload
./build.sh monitor    # Serial monitor only
./build.sh clean      # Clean build files
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### Operation Cycle
1. **Wake Up** from deep sleep (RTC timer controlled by server)
2. **Connect** to WiFi using stored credentials  
3. **Check Commands** for remote control (stay awake, force update)
4. **Fetch Image** from server: `http://serverpi.local:3000/api/current.json`
5. **Update Display** with new image data (if changed)
6. **Report Status** to server (battery, WiFi signal, device health)
7. **Enter Deep Sleep** for duration specified by server (1-6 hours)

### API Communication
- **Image Fetch:** `GET /api/current.json`
- **Status Report:** `POST /api/device-status`
- **Log Reporting:** `POST /api/logs`
- **Command Polling:** `GET /api/commands/:deviceId`

### JSON Response Format
```json
{
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_data",
  "title": "Image Title",
  "sleepDuration": 3600000000,
  "timestamp": 1704067200000,
  "imageId": "unique_id"
}
```

## üéõÔ∏è Remote Control Features

The ESP32 supports remote commands sent via the web dashboard:

- **Stay Awake** - Keeps device active for 5 minutes for debugging
- **Force Update** - Triggers immediate display refresh  
- **Update Now** - Forces content refresh on next wake cycle

Commands are queued on the server and executed when the device wakes up or during stay-awake periods.

## üîã Power Management

### Deep Sleep Features
- **Ultra Low Power:** ~10ŒºA in deep sleep mode
- **Smart Wake-up:** Server controls sleep duration (5 minutes to 12 hours)
- **Battery Monitoring:** Tracks voltage and reports to server
- **Low Battery Protection:** Extended sleep when battery < 3.3V
- **Watchdog Timer:** 5-minute timeout prevents hangs

### Battery Optimization
- **Adaptive Sleep:** Longer sleep when battery is low
- **Quick Updates:** Skips display refresh if image unchanged
- **WiFi Efficiency:** Fast reconnect with stored credentials
- **Error Handling:** Progressive retry delays on failures

## üìä Status Reporting

The ESP32 reports comprehensive status to the server:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "esp32-001",
  "status": {
    "status": "display_updated",
    "batteryVoltage": 3.85,
    "signalStrength": -45,
    "firmwareVersion": "1.0.0",
    "bootCount": 42,
    "freeHeap": 123456
  }
}
```

This data appears in the web dashboard's device monitoring section.

## üñºÔ∏è Display Features

### Image Handling
- **Base64 Decoding:** Converts server images to display format
- **6-Color Support:** Full Spectra 6 palette utilization (black, white, red, yellow, blue, green)
- **Memory Management:** Efficient RAM usage for 1150√ó1550 pixel images
- **Text Display:** Supports server-generated text images

### Display Modes
1. **Image Mode:** Shows uploaded image from server
2. **Text Mode:** Displays server-generated text content
3. **Clear Mode:** White screen when no content available

## üîß Configuration

### WiFi Configuration
Set via environment variables (required):
```bash
export WIFI_SSID="YourNetwork"
export WIFI_PASSWORD="YourPassword"
```

### Server Configuration
Default server URL (edit in `src/main.cpp` if needed):
```cpp
#define API_BASE_URL "http://serverpi.local:3000/api/"
#define STATUS_URL "http://serverpi.local:3000/api/device-status"
```

### Device Configuration
Optional device-specific settings:
```bash
export DEVICE_ID="esp32-living-room"  # Unique identifier
```

## üìö Dependencies

Automatically managed by PlatformIO:
- **ArduinoJson** (6.18.5) - JSON parsing for API responses
- **WiFi** - Network connectivity
- **HTTPClient** - API communication
- **esp_sleep** - Deep sleep functionality
- **Waveshare EPD** - E-paper display drivers (included in lib/)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues
- Check SSID and password are correct in environment variables
- Ensure 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Verify signal strength is adequate (-70dBm or better)
- Try different ESP32 board if connection is unstable

### Display Issues
- Check SPI connections match pin mapping above
- Ensure display power supply is stable (3.3V)
- Verify HAT+ compatibility with your display model
- Check for loose connections on breadboard/jumper wires

### Server Communication
- Verify Raspberry Pi server is running on port 3000
- Check network connectivity with `ping serverpi.local`
- Monitor serial output for HTTP error codes
- Verify firewall allows port 3000 access

### Power Issues
- Check battery voltage (3.2V minimum for operation)
- Verify charging circuit if using solar/external charger
- Monitor deep sleep current draw with multimeter
- Ensure no serial monitor connected during sleep

### Build Issues
- Install PlatformIO: `pip install platformio`
- Set environment variables before building
- Check USB cable and drivers for ESP32
- Try different USB port or cable if upload fails

## üåê Multiple Devices

### Unique Device IDs
Each device should have a unique identifier:
```bash
# Living room display
export DEVICE_ID="esp32-living-room"

# Kitchen display
