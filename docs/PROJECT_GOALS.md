## Design Principles

### 1. Calm Technology
The interface should be minimalistic and distraction-free. Less is more - single primary actions, no overwhelming options.

### 2. AI-Powered Discovery
Use AI to simplify art discovery - natural language search, smart suggestions, personalized recommendations.

### 3. Local First
Run on local Raspberry Pi server, no cloud dependencies, complete ownership of data and artwork.

### 4. Battery Efficiency
Ultra-low power deep sleep enables months of operation without charging, true wireless freedom.

### 5. Modular Architecture
Clean separation of concerns - HTML/CSS/JS in separate files, feature modules, easy to extend and maintain.

## Future Vision

### Next Steps
- **Personalization**: Learn user preferences, recommend similar artworks
- **Discovery**: "More like this" feature using AI similarity search
- **Scheduling**: Different art themes for different times of day
- **Analytics**: Battery usage insights and optimization suggestions

### Long-term Ideas
- Multi-display coordination and synchronization
- Community gallery sharing
- Plugin system for custom data sources
- Time-based automatic art rotation

## Project Philosophy

Glance combines the calm, paper-like quality of e-ink displays with AI-powered art discovery. The interface follows calm technology principles - minimalistic, distraction-free, and focused on the art itself. AI enhances the experience by making art discovery simple through natural language search, while the battery-powered design provides true wireless freedom.

The goal is not to add another screen to our lives, but to create a window into the world's art collections that seamlessly integrates into living spaces, powered by AI to make discovery effortless and personal.
